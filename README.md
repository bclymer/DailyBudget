DailyBudget
===========

A very small app that allows you to set rolling budgets. I made it for personal use, to keep track of how much money I spent on eating out. I set it to $5 per day, and let it keep track for me.

This project was also a challenge. I'm writing the entire thing without running it, and then hoping it all works.

Status of the challenge
===========
Failed miserably. There were 3 runtime errors that arose (all db init related), as well as a couple pretty critical bugs that caused strange calculations.
